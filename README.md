# Welcome to the   _**Bee-swarm-simulator-fan-remake**_   project !

Im a player of the bee swarm simulator game (on roblox) but I always wanted to have a good objective to create a game.
So I fixed my objective : It's to recreate a bee swarm simulator but not in roblox and modify it  add things and of course make it multiplayer compatible
For reference I use Unity and VS code to build the game and I use the game for refence like the mechanics.

***
There is just a problem if I want to be multiplayer compatible I need a host and I don't have one , the obvious choice would be to publish it on Steam and use steamworks but I don't want to pay 100$ to publish it because the game is free so there no point to pay just for that for now I will start with a creative mod(Singleplayer)
***

For obvious reasons all the inspiration come from @Onett and I don't want to resell his work so nothing will be paid when it is published
